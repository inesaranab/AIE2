We analyze more than 80 commercial and\\nnon-commercial implementations that have emerged since 2023, including\\nOpenAI/Deep Research, Gemini/Deep Research, Perplexity/Deep Research, and\\nnumerous open-source alternatives. Through comprehensive examination, we\\npropose a novel hierarchical taxonomy that categorizes systems according to\\nfour fundamental technical dimensions: foundation models and reasoning engines,\\ntool utilization and environmental interaction, task planning and execution\\ncontrol, and knowledge synthesis and output generation. We explore the\\narchitectural patterns, implementation approaches, and domain-specific\\nadaptations that characterize these systems across academic, scientific,\\nbusiness, and educational applications. Our analysis reveals both the\\nsignificant capabilities of current implementations and the technical and\\nethical challenges they present regarding information accuracy, privacy,\\nintellectual property, and accessibility. The survey concludes by identifying\\npromising research directions in advanced reasoning architectures, multimodal\\nintegration, domain specialization, human-AI collaboration, and ecosystem\\nstandardization that will likely shape the future evolution of this\\ntransformative technology. By providing a comprehensive framework for\\nunderstanding Deep Research systems, this survey contributes to both the\\ntheoretical understanding of AI-augmented knowledge work and the practical\\ndevelopment of more capable, responsible, and accessible research technologies.\\nThe paper resources can be viewed at\\nhttps://github.com/scienceaix/deepresearch.\\n\\nPublished: 2021-03-05\\nTitle: A comprehensive survey on point cloud registration\\nAuthors: Xiaoshui Huang, Guofeng Mei, Jian Zhang, Rana Abbas\\nSummary: Registration is a transformation estimation problem between two point clouds,\\nwhich has a unique and critical role in numerous computer vision applications.\\nThe developments of optimization-based methods and deep learning methods have\\nimproved registration robustness and efficiency. Recently, the combinations of\\noptimization-based and deep learning methods have further improved performance.\\nHowever, the connections between optimization-based and deep learning methods\\nare still unclear. Moreover, with the recent development of 3D sensors and 3D\\nreconstruction techniques, a new research direction emerges to align\\ncross-source point clouds. This survey conducts a comprehensive survey,\\nincluding both same-source and cross-source registration methods, and summarize\\nthe connections between optimization-based and deep learning methods, to\\nprovide further research insight. This survey also builds a new benchmark to\\nevaluate the state-of-the-art registration algorithms in solving cross-source\\nchallenges.

            "Context Engineering is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that focuses on designing, managing, and utilizing contextual information to improve the functionality and adaptability of systems, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and pervasive computing. It involves understanding and engineering the context in which systems operate to enhance their performance, relevance, and user experience.\n",

            "The concept of Context Engineering began gaining attention in the early 2000s with the rise of ubiquitous computing and context-aware systems. It became more prominent as researchers and industry professionals recognized the importance of context in creating more intelligent and responsive systems. The term itself and the formalization of the field started to take shape around the mid-2000s, with significant contributions from academia and industry exploring how to systematically incorporate context into system design.\n",

            "Fine-tuning is a machine learning technique used to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific task or dataset. Instead of training a model from scratch, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, fine-tuning involves taking an existing model that has already learned general features from a large dataset and then further training it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This process helps the model specialize and improve its performance on the target task while leveraging the knowledge it has already acquired.\n",

            "Fine-tuning has been a common practice in machine learning and deep learning for many years, especially in natural language processing and computer vision. However, it gained significant prominence and broke onto the scene in a major way with the rise of large pre-trained models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in 2018 and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models. These models demonstrated that large-scale pre-training followed by fine-tuning could achieve state-of-the-art results across a wide range of tasks, revolutionizing the field.\n",
