Education is a major use case for ChatGPT. 10.2% of all user\\nmessages and 36% of Practical Guidance messages are requests for Tutoring or Teaching. Another\\nlarge share - 8.5% in total and 30% of Practical Guidance - is general how-to advice on a variety\\nof topics. Technical Help includes Computer Programming (4.2% of messages), Mathematical Calcu-\\nlations (3%), and Data Analysis (0.4%).

In contrast, Zao-Sanders (2025) estimates that Therapy/Companionship is\\nthe most prevalent use case for generative AI.9\\nWe also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First,\\nwe show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time,\\nand may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active\\nusers had typically masculine first names.10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025,\\nwith active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that\\nnearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps\\nhave narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively\\nfaster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and\\nusers in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work.\\nWe introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is\\nseeking, using a simple rubric that we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing.11\\nAsking is when the\\nuser is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving\\nmodels of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and\\nSchneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)). Doing is when the user wants to produce some output\\nor perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al.\\n(2003)). Expressing is when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or\\naction. We estimate that about 49% of messages are Asking, 40% are Doing, and 11% are Expressing.\\nHowever, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified as Doing (e.g., performing\\njob tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those are Writing tasks. The relative frequency of writing-\\nrelated conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all\\nwhite-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top “soft” skills demanded by\\nemployers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of\\ngenerative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs\\nsuch as writing and software code.\\nWe also map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network\\n(O*NET), a survey of job characteristics supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. We find that\\nabout 81% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: 1) obtaining,\\ndocumenting, and interpreting information; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems,\\nand thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage\\nare highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activities Getting\\nInformation and Making Decisions and Solving Problems are in the top five of message frequency in\\nnearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales\\noccupations.\\nOverall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT\\nuse cases in most jobs. This is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is'),\n",

       " 'response': 'The provided context indicates that the average person primarily uses AI like ChatGPT for requests related to modifying their inputs rather than creating new content. Common use cases include education, where about 10.2% of messages are for tutoring or teaching, and general how-to advice, accounting for 8.5%. Technical help such as programming, mathematical calculations, and data analysis are also relevant, though to a lesser extent. Additionally, many users engage in self-expression topics like relationships, personal reflection, games, and role play, though these constitute a smaller portion of overall usage. Overall, most people use AI for information seeking, decision support, and producing written content or software code, with a notable emphasis on writing tasks that are relevant across many white-collar jobs.'}"

    "\n",
    "1.1 A powerful LLM is crucial because this system requires **complex reasoning and decision-making**:\n",
    "- Tool Selection: The LLM must intelligently choose between different tools (Tavily search, RAG retrieval, Arxiv search) based on the question context\n",
    "- Multi-step Reasoning: It needs to understand when to search for recent info vs. use existing data, and how to synthesize information from multiple sources\n",
    "- Context Understanding: It must comprehend complex research questions and determine the best approach to answer them\n",
    "- Coordination: In multi-agent setups, the LLM acts as a supervisor that must understand conversation flow and decide which agent should act next\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 The agent must perform several high-level cognitive tasks that require sophisticated reasoning:\n",
    "- Information Synthesis: Combining data from hardcoded PDFs, web search results, and Arxiv papers into coherent answers\n",
    "Source Evaluation: Determining which information sources are most relevant and reliable for a given question\n",
    "- Workflow Orchestration: Deciding the optimal sequence of operations (search first, then retrieve, then synthesize)\n",
    "- Context Switching: Understanding when to switch between different tools and agents based on the conversation state\n",
    "- Quality Assessment: Evaluating whether retrieved information is sufficient or if additional searches are needed\n",
    "- Multi-modal Integration: Combining different types of information (structured data, web content, academic papers) into a unified response\n",

    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the Agent uses specific tools, we can:\n",
    "- Modify the system prompt to explicitly instruct tool usage order\n",
    "- Create **tool-specific agents** and route between them\n",
    "- Use conditional logic in the graph to force specific tool sequences\n",
    "- Implement **explicit tool** calls instead of letting the LLM decide\n",
    "- Use tool binding with specific function calls rather than open-ended tool selection\n",

As artificial intelligence (AI) applications have exponentially evolved in complexity, transitioning from traditional methods to context engineering has become essential. This report aims to illuminate the growth of context engineering, elucidate its significance in AI usage, and assess its transformative impacts on user interactions with AI systems.\\n\\n## Understanding Context Engineering\\nContext engineering refers to the strategic structuring of the informational landscape that governs how AI systems, especially LLMs, interpret and generate responses. This approach transcends basic prompt engineering, focusing on the holistic design of the contextual environment that shapes AI outputs. The goal is to meticulously curate and filter data from diverse sources, allowing LLMs to engage more effectively and accurately with users.\\n\\nKey characteristics of context engineering include:\\n\\n- **Optimization of Information Delivery**: Experts propose that context engineering functions as a method to optimize how LLMs receive and process information (Hatty, Turing College, 2025), enhancing the quality of AI responses.\\n- **Dynamic Interaction**: This model operates on a principle similar to the interplay between a computer processor (the model) and memory (the context), wherein a well-defined context significantly elevates the performance and relevance of outputs.\\n\\n## The Growth of Context Engineering\\nThe development of context engineering stems from the observed limitations of earlier AI interaction paradigms. Initially, LLMs were adept at managing discrete tasks, primarily hinging on isolated prompts. However, as demands escalated for sophisticated accuracy, context awareness, and multi-turn reasoning, the inadequacy of simplistic prompt extension became apparent. This highlighted the necessity for context engineering, which reshapes the communication dynamic between users and AI, facilitating increasingly complex workflows.\\n\\nSeveral factors driving this rise include:\\n\\n1. **Increasing Application Complexity**: As LLM tasks become more intricate, a nuanced understanding of context is crucial for navigating multi-turn dialogues and maintaining coherence.\\n2. **Recognition of Context Errors**: The shift in focus from model-dependent errors to context-driven errors highlights the critical role of providing adequate context for optimal AI performance.\\n3. **Evolution of Agent-Based Systems**: AI developments are leaning toward systems equipped with persistent memory and adaptive reasoning, both of which heavily rely on effectively structured context (Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke, 2025).\\n\\n## Impact on AI Usage\\n\\nThe growing prominence of context engineering is paving the way for several significant impacts on how people utilize AI technologies:\\n\\n1. **Enhanced User Experience**: The coherence and relevance of AI interactions improve substantially. Users benefit from more contextually aware responses, creating a smoother and more intuitive experience.\\n2. **Increased Accuracy and Efficiency**: Effective context utilization allows AI systems to achieve greater accuracy in task execution, reducing the workload on users who might otherwise need to provide extensive guidance.\\n3. **New Skills for AI Practitioners**: The rising importance of context engineering necessitates that developers and engineers acquire new competencies, emphasizing a deeper understanding of how to create and manage effective information ecosystems within AI platforms.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nIn 2025, context engineering has established itself as a transformative force in the artificial intelligence landscape. By fostering better interactions and communication between users and large language models, context engineering enhances the fidelity of AI outputs while enabling broader applications across various sectors. As the evolution of AI technologies progresses, expertise in context engineering will undoubtedly shape the next chapter of human-AI collaboration, highlighting its essential role in the future digital context.\\n\\n### References\\n1.

    "### Report on the Rise of Context Engineering in the LLM Space in 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "As we move further into 2025, the landscape of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, particularly in the domain of large language models (LLMs). One significant trend emerging is \"context engineering,\" which has begun to outpace the earlier focus on prompt engineering. This report explores how context engineering is reshaping the dynamics of AI usage, enhancing the capabilities of LLMs to perform complex tasks, and ultimately influencing the way users interact with AI technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Emergence of Context Engineering\n",
    "In previous years, prompt engineering involved crafting inputs to guide LLMs to generate desired outputs. However, by 2025, the limitations of traditional prompt engineering have become evident, especially as applications require more dynamic interactions and multi-turn dialogues. Context engineering has emerged as a new paradigm, prioritizing the construction of strategies and systems that enable LLMs to access and utilize extensive contextual information effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern LLMs, such as GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3, now boast context windows that can handle up to 1 million tokens. This substantial increase allows these models to grasp more extensive content, such as books or lengthy documents, fundamentally changing what they can achieve in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Developments in Context Engineering\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Knowledge Management**: The shift towards context engineering facilitates more sophisticated knowledge management within AI systems. These systems now use persistent memory and adaptive reasoning, enabling them to maintain context across interactions. For example, agent-based LLMs can now engage in workflows requiring multiple exchanges, which is vital for complex applications requiring follow-ups and extended dialogues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Context Lengths**: Advances in transformer architectures have led to the possibility of extending native context lengths dramatically. As a result, LLMs can process larger datasets directly, enhancing their capacity to deliver accurate and relevant outputs without extensive re-prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Compression and Retrieval**: Techniques such as context compression, where information is stored externally or synthesized to maximize relevance, are gaining traction.
