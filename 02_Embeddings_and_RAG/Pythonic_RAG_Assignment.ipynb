        "1. **Yes** ‚Äî with the new embedding models (`text-embedding-3-small` and `text-embedding-3-large`), you can change the embedding size by using the `dimensions` parameter in the embeddings API request. By default, `text-embedding-3-small` outputs vectors of length 1536 and `text-embedding-3-large` outputs 3072, but you can request a smaller size (e.g., 256, 512, 1024) to reduce cost and storage requirements. \n",
        "2. OpenAI achieves this flexibility through a **specialized training technique**:Matryoshka Representation Learning (see [arXiv:2205.13147](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13147)) that allows embeddings to be shortened without losing their semantic meaning. Essentially, the embeddings are trained so that truncating dimensions still preserves most of their representational power. This lets developers trade off between performance and efficiency depending on their application needs.  "

            "Response: The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to a situation where a CEO or startup founder, who used to lead a particular functional area (such as product management, sales, or marketing), ends up hiring a weak executive to run that same function after they have moved on to the CEO role. This happens because the CEO has difficulty letting go of the function that originally brought them success and wants to remain \"the man\" in that area, so they deliberately or unconsciously hire someone weak for that executive role to maintain control. The name comes from Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who had been a brilliant TV network executive but, after acquiring ABC, the network fell to fourth place. Eisner‚Äôs response was to say that if he had extra time, he could personally turn around ABC instead of relying on the executives he hired. This illustrates the problem of not empowering strong executives in the CEO‚Äôs former specialty. (Source 1)\n",

            "Response: The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem,\" as described in the context, refers to a common issue where a CEO or startup founder struggles to let go of the specific functional area that originally brought them success and their leadership role. This problem manifests when such leaders deliberately hire weak executives to run the area they used to manage themselves.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example:\n",
            "- A CEO who used to be a product manager may hire a weak product management executive.\n",
            "- A CEO who used to be in sales may hire a weak sales executive.\n",
            "- A CEO who used to be in marketing may hire a weak marketing executive.\n",
            "\n",
            "The naming of this problem comes from Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney. Michael Eisner had been a brilliant TV network executive before becoming CEO of Disney. When Disney acquired ABC, the TV network promptly fell to fourth place under his leadership. Eisner's response was to say, ‚ÄúIf I had an extra two days a week, I could turn around ABC myself.‚Äù However, he did not have that extra time, implying he couldn't effectively manage both the CEO role and directly run the specialty function.\n",
            "\n",
            "This problem highlights that CEOs often cannot or do not entrust strong executives to lead the functions they once handled, thereby potentially weakening those parts of their organization and hampering overall performance.\n",
