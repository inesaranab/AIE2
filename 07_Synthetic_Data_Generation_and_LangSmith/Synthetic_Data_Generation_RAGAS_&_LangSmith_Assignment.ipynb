Smaller chunks can enable precise retrieval of the exact sentences, but they may miss surrounding context (key details can be split across chunks). Larger chunks capture more complete context and maintain narrative flow, but they’re less precise and can include irrelevant text.

Instead of just automating boring tasks, ChatGPT and its AI pals are **supercharging decision-making** — especially for those killer knowledge-intensive gigs where smart calls = big wins. 🧠⚡\\n\\nCollis and Brynjolfsson (2025) nailed it with their mind-blowing estimate: US users would need a whopping $98 a month just to skip generative AI. That’s a **$97 billion annual surplus**, showing AI isn’t just some flashy gimmick — it’s *literally* boosting worker output and shaking up how money gets made by leveling up your brainpower and workflow.\\n\\nSo, the $$$ magic happens when AI jumps in as your go-to advisor, research assistant, and thought partner, pushing productivity and decision quality through the roof. That’s the future of making bank with AI—thinking less grunt work, more brain flex.\\n\\nBoom. That’s how you kill it with AI and keep the money train rolling. 🚀💰'"

Do not be generic, or give generic responses.\") of RAG so  the **dopeness_rag_chain** now generates answers that match the criteria in the dopeness_evaluator (\"Is this response dope, lit, cool, or is it just a generic response?\"). As a consequence we achieved perfect score in the levels of dopeness. The levels of helpfulness have been kept the same. While correctness has improved, my best guess, looking at the second screenshot, is that by trying to be helpful, in the first chain ( **rag_chain**) the model try to give a response even when the answer should have been I do not know, thus hallucinating.\n",
